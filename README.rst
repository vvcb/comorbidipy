Python package to calculate comorbidity scores including Charlson Comorbidity Score and Elixhauser Score and their weighted variants.

This library is effectively a rewrite of the excellent R library `comorbidity` (<https://github.com/ellessenne/comorbidity/>) by Alessandro Gasparini (<https://www.ellessenne.xyz/>).
Please check out his work and the excellent documentation he has produced.

The Python API has been modified slightly to allow adjusting for age. Only the `comorbidity` function has been reproduced here at present.
